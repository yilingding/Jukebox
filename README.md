This program works like a Jukebox, and user must log in to check what they could do.

The are two types of user accound:
1. The administrator:
    He could log in and behave as a normal user with the added capability of adding and removing accounts.  
    
    
2. The normal user:

    1.Each user will be allowed to play up to 1500 minutes worth of "free" Jukebox music, which means user with two minutes remaining can not play a song that takes 121 or more seconds to play.
    
    
    2. Each user can only select a maximum of three (3) songs on a given day. Also no song can be selected more than three times a day.  Both apply to the time selected, not when they finish playing.
